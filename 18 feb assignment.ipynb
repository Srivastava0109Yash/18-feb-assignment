The website or app uses an API provided by an airline to access the airline's reservation system and retrieve the available flights, fares, and other relevant information. Once you select a flight and complete the booking process, the website or app uses the same API to communicate with the airline's system and confirm your reservation. The API facilitates the communication and data exchange between the website or app and the airline's system, making the booking process seamless and efficient."

    "REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two popular architectural styles for building web services. The main differences between REST and SOAP are as follows:\n",

SOAP services, on the other hand, are procedure-oriented, meaning that they are designed around a set of remote procedures or methods that can be invoked by a client.\n",

    "__Architecture__: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that emphasizes simplicity and scalability, while SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol that focuses on reliability and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Protocol__: REST uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as its primary communication protocol, while SOAP can use different protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, or TCP.\n",

    "__Data Format__: REST uses lightweight and easily readable formats such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (Extensible Markup Language) for data transmission, while SOAP uses XML exclusively.\n",

    "__Messaging__: REST uses simple HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, while SOAP defines its own messaging structure with envelopes, headers, and body.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Message Size__: REST messages are typically smaller than SOAP messages due to the simpler message structure and lack of additional headers and tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Caching__: REST supports caching to improve performance, while SOAP does not have built-in caching mechanisms.\n",

    "__Error Handling__: REST uses HTTP error codes to indicate errors, while SOAP uses custom fault messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Security__: SOAP has built-in security features such as WS-Security and WS-SecureConversation, while REST relies on HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for secure communication.\n",
