For instance, if you use a weather app on your smartphone, it most likely receives weather data from an API provided by a weather service provider."

The website or app uses an API provided by an airline to access the airline's reservation system and retrieve the available flights, fares, and other relevant information. Once you select a flight and complete the booking process, the website or app uses the same API to communicate with the airline's system and confirm your reservation. The API facilitates the communication and data exchange between the website or app and the airline's system, making the booking process seamless and efficient."
